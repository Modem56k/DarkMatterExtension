# A proof of concept for a non-system plugin for Foundry VTT

This module extends the Foundry VTT DND5e system module.
1. Adds three skills to character and npcs: Piloting, Technology, and Data
1. Modifies the style of the default DND5e character sheet to show those
  skills better.
1. Adds a vehicle sheet that adds some ship attributes:
  * Shield Points
  * Maneuver
  * Engine Class
1. Weapons can be Simple or Martial Blasters.
1. Weapons can have an Automatic type.
1. Simple and Martial Blasters are checkboxes for characters.
