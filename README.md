# A proof of concept for a non-system plugin for Foundry VTT

This should add three skills to your characters and alter the default
character sheet slightly to see those skills better.

## Dependencies
This plugin depends on the Foundry VTT DND5E system module to work.

## Install
Use this manifest:
`https://gitlab.com/csmcfarland/dmpoc/raw/master/module.json`

## Thank You
Special thank to those of you who have pointed me in the right direction
or given me insight be letting me see your code, or even just helped
by asking good questions or listening to me.
