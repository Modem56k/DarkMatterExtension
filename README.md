# A proof of concept for a non-system plugin for Foundry VTT

This module extends the Foundry VTT DND5e system module.
* Adds three skills to character and NPCs:
  * Piloting
  * Technology
  * Data
* Modifies the style of the default DND5e character sheet to show those
  skills better.
* Adds a vehicle sheet that adds some ship attributes:
  * Shield Points
  * Maneuver
  * Engine Class
* Weapons can be Simple or Martial Blasters.
* Weapons can have an Automatic type.
* Simple and Martial Blasters are checkboxes for characters.
