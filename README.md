# A proof of concept for a non-system plugin for Foundry VTT

Right now, this adds three items (features) to characters. You can use
these items to roll for Data, Technology, or Piloting if you are
proficient in that skill. If you are not proficient, the assumption is that
you will just make an attribute check.

## Dependencies
This plugin depends on the Foundry VTT DND5E system module to work.

## Install
Use this manifest:
`https://gitlab.com/csmcfarland/dmpoc/raw/master/module.json`

## Thank You
Special thank to those of you who have pointed me in the right direction
or given me insight be letting me see your code, or even just helped
by asking good questions or listening to me.
